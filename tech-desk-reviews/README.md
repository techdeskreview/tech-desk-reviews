# Tech Desk Independent Reviews

This is a high-performance, accessible Angular application for Tech Desk Reviews.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Angular source code
- `src/data.ts` - Central data store for products (Preserve EXACTLY for affiliate compliance)
- `public/assets/images/` - Image assets (Use mapped kebab-case names)

## Setup & Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Image Setup:
   - Ensure the folder `public/assets/images` exists.
   - Rename your source images according to `image-mapping.txt`.
   - Place them in `public/assets/images`.

3. Development Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Production Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The output will be in the `dist/` or `docs/` folder (depending on config), ready for GitHub Pages or static hosting.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- A "Skip to content" link is implemented.
- Landmarks (`nav`, `main`, `footer`) are used correctly.
- Menus have correct ARIA attributes.
- Ensure any future colors meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
- See `accessibility-statement` page for details.

## Content Rules
- **DO NOT** modify affiliate links in `src/data.ts`.
- **DO NOT** rewrite product reviews generated by the editorial team.
- Always use kebab-case for new image assets.

## Deployment
To deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Commit the `dist` folder contents to the `gh-pages` branch or configure GitHub Pages to serve from `/docs` if built there.
